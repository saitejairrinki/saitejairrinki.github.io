GIT BASICS Command Usage git init <directory> Create empty Git repo in specified directory. Run with no arguments to initialize the current directory as a git repository. git clone <repo> Clone repo located at <repo> onto local machine. Original repo can be located on the local filesystem or on a remote machine via HTTP or SSH. git config user.name <name> Define author name to be used for all commits in current repo. Devs commonly use --global flag to set config options for current user. git add <directory> Stage all changes in <directory> for the next commit. Replace <directory> with a <file> to change a specific file. git commit -m \"<message>\" Commit the staged snapshot, but instead of launching a text editor, use as the commit message. git status List which files are staged, unstaged, and untracked. git log Display the entire commit history using the default format. git diff Show unstaged changes between your index and working directory. UNDOING CHANGES Command Usage git revert <commit> Create new commit that undoes all of the changes made in , then apply it to the current branch. git reset <file> Remove from the staging area, but leave the working directory unchanged. This unstages a file without overwriting any changes. git clean -n Shows which files would be removed from working directory.Use the -f flag in place of the -n flag to execute the clean. GIT BRANCHES Command Usage git branch List all of the branches in your repo. Add a argument to create a new branch with the name . git checkout -b <branch> Create and check out a new branch named . Drop the -b flag to checkout an existing branch. git merge <branch> Merge into the current branch. REMOTE REPOSITORIES Command Usage git remote add <name> <url> Create a new connection to a remote repo. After adding a remote,you can use as a shortcu for in other commands. git fetch <remote> <branch> Fetches a specific , from the repo. Leave off to fetch all remote refs. git pull Fetch the specified remote\u2019s copy of current branch and immediately merge it into the local copy. git push <remote> <branch> Push the branch to , along with necessary commits and objects. Creates named branch in the remote repo if it doesn\u2019t exist. GIT RESET Command Usage git reset Reset staging area to match most recent commit, but leave the working directory unchanged. git reset --hard Reset staging area and working directory to match most recent commit and overwrites all changes in the working directory. git reset <commit> Move the current branch tip backward to , reset the staging area to match, but leave the working directory alone. git reset --hard <commit> Same as previous, but resets both the staging area & working directory to match. Deletes uncommitted changes, and all commits after . GIT PULL Command Usage git pull --rebase <remote> Fetch the remote\u2019s copy of current branch and rebases it into the localcopy. Uses git rebase instead of merge to integrate the branches. GIT PUSH Command Usage git push <remote> --force Forces the git push even if it results in a non-fast-forward merge. Do not use the --force flag unless you\u2019re absolutely sure you know what you\u2019re doing. git push <remote> --all Push all of your local branches to the specified remote. git push <remote> --tags Tags aren\u2019t automatically pushed when you push a branch or use the --all flag.
